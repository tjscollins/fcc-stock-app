# FCC Stock App

## Overview

This application was built for [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com)'s **Chart the Stock Market** challenge as part of their Back-End Development Certification.

The application is based on my own [MERN Template](http://github.com/tjscollins/mern-template), a full-stack webapp template developed to allow for rapid development and deployment of React-Redux applications on a NodeJS/MongoDB backend.
